# Forecasting and Machine Learning Model for Daily Sales

This project focuses on building a forecasting model to predict daily sales and applying machine learning techniques to optimize the sales prediction process for a restaurant dataset. The goal is to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a forecasting model, and train a machine learning model to predict total sales.

## Project Overview

The project is structured to go through the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the raw data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to uncover insights, visualize trends, and explore relationships between variables.
3. **Forecasting Model**: Apply a time series forecasting model to predict future sales.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: Train a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to predict daily sales based on various features.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).




## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `cmdstanpy` for forecasting (if applicable)
- `statsmodels` (if using stats models for time series forecasting)

To install the required dependencies, you can use:

pip install -r requirements.txt
